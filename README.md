# Final Major Project Prototype Source Code

This is the repository for the source code of my prototype.

Download the full folder and then run the .uproject file, which should then open Unreal Engine.

The game should load into the title map, so hitting the start button will begin the game.

Controls:

WASD - Movement

Mouse - Aiming

Left Click - Fire weapon

Right Click While looking at an enemy - Lock on (makes the camera always point 
 towards them until you release right click)

Q - Fire Missile (Needs Missile ammo to fire)

E - Slimegrab (Look at an Ammo container and activate slimegrab to grab it from a distance)

1,2,3,4 - Switch Weapons

Ctrl - Toggle Slimeball mode

When in slimeball mode you move faster, can double jump and wall jump, fit through tight spaces, and also spindash by holding and then releasing Shift.
